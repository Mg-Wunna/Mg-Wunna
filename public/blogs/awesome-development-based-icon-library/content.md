## The Icon Hunt Struggle

A few months ago, I was building my developer portfolio and wanted to showcase the technologies I work with. What seemed like a simple task turned into a time-consuming challenge:

- Finding transparent background icons
- Maintaining consistent sizes and styles
- Dealing with low-resolution images that looked pixelated
- Managing different color schemes for dark/light modes
- Hunting for specific tech stack logos
